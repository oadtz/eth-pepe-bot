# Project TODO: ETH/PEPE Trading Bot (Live Trading)

This document outlines the current status of the ETH/PEPE Trading Bot project and lists future work, improvements, and critical considerations.

## Project Overview

This project implements a **live cryptocurrency trading bot** for the ETH/PEPE pair. It features a backend that generates trading signals based on technical indicators and executes real trades on Uniswap V3, with comprehensive risk management and monitoring capabilities. The entire application is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose.

**CURRENT STATUS:** The bot is now in **LIVE TRADING MODE** with aggressive day trading settings optimized for PEPE's volatility. All critical issues have been resolved and the bot is functioning correctly.

## Current State & Achieved Milestones

### Backend (Python)

- **Core Logic:** Implements SMA Crossover, RSI, and MACD indicators for signal generation with ultra-aggressive day trading settings.
- **Data Fetching:** Fetches current price data directly from Uniswap V3 smart contracts using `web3.py` with RPC rotation.
- **Historical Data:** Efficient caching system with 72 hours of real blockchain data, updated every 3 seconds.
- **Live Trading:** Real transaction execution on Uniswap V3 with comprehensive risk management.
- **Risk Management:** Emergency stop loss, daily limits, gas management, and balance validation.
- **Persistence:** Uses SQLite (via SQLAlchemy) to store live trades, portfolio balances, and risk events.
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging to the console for monitoring bot activity, signals, and live portfolio updates.
- **Configuration:** Centralized configuration in `config.py` with sensitive data loaded from `.env`.
- **Containerization:** Dockerized for easy setup and deployment.
- **RPC Rotation:** Automatic switching between multiple RPC providers to handle rate limits.

### Performance Metrics (Current)

- **Cycle Time:** 3 seconds (ultra-fast for day trading)
- **Data Efficiency:** Smart caching - only 1 new data point per cycle
- **Signal Quality:** Multiple indicators with any-signal-triggers-trade logic
- **Risk Management:** 20% emergency stop, 50 daily trades, 10 ETH volume limit
- **Technical Indicators:** SMA (3/8), RSI (5-period, 35/65), MACD (12/26/9)
- **RPC Reliability:** Automatic rotation between 6 providers (1 primary + 5 public)

## âœ… RESOLVED ISSUES

### 1. Price Fetching Coroutine Error âœ… FIXED

**Problem:** Price fetching was returning coroutine objects instead of float values
**Solution:** Fixed async/sync mismatch in `get_current_uniswap_v3_price` function
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED - Bot now fetches real prices correctly

### 2. RPC Rate Limiting âœ… FIXED

**Problem:** Infura rate limits causing data fetching failures
**Solution:** Implemented RPC rotation with 6 providers (1 primary + 5 public fallbacks)
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED - Automatic provider switching on rate limits

### 3. Emergency Stop Recovery âœ… IMPLEMENTED

**Problem:** No automatic recovery from emergency stops
**Solution:** Added automatic recovery system with configurable thresholds
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED - 2-hour recovery wait with 5% threshold

### 4. Pool Address Verification âœ… FIXED

**Problem:** Incorrect PEPE/WETH pool addresses
**Solution:** Updated to correct Uniswap V3 pool addresses with multiple fee tiers
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED - Using correct mainnet pool addresses

## Current Bot Status

**âœ… FUNCTIONAL:** The bot is currently running correctly with:

- Real-time price fetching from Uniswap V3
- Proper technical indicator calculations (RSI: 48.36, MACD working)
- Trading signal generation (SELL/HOLD signals detected)
- Emergency stop protection active
- RPC rotation handling rate limits
- Correct balance tracking and P&L calculation

**ðŸ”„ EMERGENCY STOP:** Currently in emergency stop mode (2 hours remaining) - this is normal safety behavior

## Day Trading Optimization TODOs

### High Priority - Immediate Impact

#### 1. Real Volume Data Integration

**Current Issue:** Using placeholder volume data (1,000,000)
**Impact:** Volume-based signals are not accurate
**Solution:** Implement real volume collection from Uniswap V3 events

```python
# Query Uniswap V3 Swap events for real volume data
# This requires querying the blockchain for actual swap events
# and calculating volume from the event logs
```

#### 2. Data Granularity Improvement

**Current Issue:** Hourly data points may miss intra-hour price movements
**Solution:** Reduce data intervals for faster signal generation

```python
# Change from hourly to 15-minute data
blocks_per_interval = 60  # 15 minutes instead of 240 (1 hour)
NUM_HOURS_DATA = 96       # Increase to 4 days for more data points
```

#### 3. Volatility-Based Dynamic RSI

**Current Issue:** Fixed RSI levels don't adapt to market volatility
**Solution:** Implement dynamic RSI levels based on recent volatility

```python
# Dynamic RSI levels based on recent volatility
volatility = price.std() / price.mean()
dynamic_oversold = 35 - (volatility * 10)
dynamic_overbought = 65 + (volatility * 10)
```

### Medium Priority - Enhanced Performance

#### 4. Support/Resistance Levels

**Implementation:** Add pivot points and support/resistance detection

```python
# Calculate pivot points
pivot = (high + low + close) / 3
resistance1 = 2 * pivot - low
support1 = 2 * pivot - high
```

#### 5. Bollinger Bands Integration

**Implementation:** Add Bollinger Bands for volatility-based signals

```python
# Bollinger Bands signals
if price < lower_band:  # Oversold
    buy_signals += 1
if price > upper_band:  # Overbought
    sell_signals += 1
```

#### 6. Multi-timeframe Analysis

**Implementation:** Combine signals from different timeframes

```python
# 15min, 1hr, 4hr timeframes
short_term_signal = get_signal(15min_data)
medium_term_signal = get_signal(1hr_data)
long_term_signal = get_signal(4hr_data)
```

### Low Priority - Advanced Features

#### 7. Market Sentiment Analysis

**Implementation:** Add social media sentiment indicators

- Twitter sentiment analysis
- Reddit r/pepe sentiment
- Telegram channel sentiment

#### 8. Advanced Risk Management

**Implementation:** Dynamic position sizing based on volatility

```python
# Volatility-based position sizing
volatility_factor = 1 - (current_volatility / max_volatility)
position_size = base_position * volatility_factor
```

#### 9. Performance Analytics Dashboard

**Implementation:** Add detailed performance metrics

- Win rate analysis
- Average trade duration
- Sharpe ratio calculation
- Maximum drawdown tracking

## Future Work & TODOs

### High Priority

- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improve error recovery and notification systems for live trading scenarios.
- **Gas Optimization:** Implement dynamic gas price strategies for cost-effective trading.

### Medium Priority

- **Backtesting Framework:** Implement comprehensive backtesting to validate strategies before live deployment.
- **Strategy Optimization:** Add machine learning-based parameter optimization.
- **Multi-Pair Trading:** Extend to other meme coins or trading pairs.

### Low Priority / Enhancements

- **Enhanced Frontend Visualizations:**
  - Add interactive candlestick charts with indicators overlay
  - Real-time portfolio performance charts
  - Trade history with detailed analytics
- **Mobile App:** Develop mobile monitoring app for on-the-go trading oversight.
