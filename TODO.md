### 6. Transaction Verification ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Bot reported failed trades that actually succeeded
**Solution:** Improved transaction verification by checking transfer events and token balances
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Accurate trade success/failure reporting

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS

### 1. Network Connectivity Resilience (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Web3 connection failures trigger emergency stop
**Impact:** Bot stops trading during network issues
**Solution:** Implement robust reconnection logic with exponential backoff

```python
# Enhanced Web3 reconnection
async def ensure_web3_connection():
    max_retries = 10
    base_delay = 5
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        if get_w3() and get_w3().is_connected():
            return True
        delay = base_delay * (2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
        await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    return False
```

### 2. Dynamic Gas Price Management (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Fixed gas prices cause transaction failures during congestion
**Impact:** Failed transactions and lost opportunities
**Solution:** Implement dynamic gas pricing based on network conditions

```python
# Dynamic gas pricing
async def get_optimal_gas_price():
    base_gas = get_w3().eth.gas_price
    network_congestion = await get_network_congestion()
    if network_congestion > 0.7:  # High congestion
        return int(base_gas * 1.5)  # 50% premium
    return base_gas
```

### 3. Transaction Retry Logic (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Failed transactions are not retried
**Impact:** Lost trading opportunities
**Solution:** Implement automatic retry with increasing gas prices

```python
# Transaction retry logic
async def execute_transaction_with_retry(tx_func, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            gas_price = await get_optimal_gas_price() * (1.2 ** attempt)
            return await tx_func(gas_price)
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e
            await asyncio.sleep(5)
```

### 4. Emergency Stop Network Exception (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Network issues trigger emergency stop instead of graceful handling
**Impact:** Unnecessary trading pauses
**Solution:** Distinguish between network issues and actual losses

```python
# Network-aware emergency stop
async def check_emergency_stop():
    if not get_w3() or not get_w3().is_connected():
        return "NETWORK_ISSUE"  # Don't trigger emergency stop
    # Check actual portfolio loss
    if portfolio_loss > EMERGENCY_STOP_THRESHOLD:
        return "EMERGENCY_STOP"
    return "CONTINUE"
```

## Day Trading Optimization TODOs

### High Priority - Immediate Impact

#### 1. Real Volume Data Integration

**Current Issue:** Using synthetic volume data
**Impact:** Volume-based signals are not accurate
**Solution:** Implement real volume collection from Uniswap V3 events

```python
# Query Uniswap V3 Swap events for real volume data
# This requires querying the blockchain for actual swap events
# and calculating volume from the event logs
```

#### 2. Data Granularity Improvement

**Current Issue:** Hourly data points may miss intra-hour price movements
**Solution:** Reduce data intervals for faster signal generation

```python
# Change from hourly to 15-minute data
blocks_per_interval = 60  # 15 minutes instead of 240 (1 hour)
NUM_HOURS_DATA = 96       # Increase to 4 days for more data points
```

#### 3. Volatility-Based Dynamic RSI

**Current Issue:** Fixed RSI levels don't adapt to market volatility
**Solution:** Implement dynamic RSI levels based on recent volatility

```python
# Dynamic RSI levels based on recent volatility
volatility = price.std() / price.mean()
dynamic_oversold = 35 - (volatility * 10)
dynamic_overbought = 65 + (volatility * 10)
```

### Medium Priority - Enhanced Performance

#### 4. Support/Resistance Levels

**Implementation:** Add pivot points and support/resistance detection

```python
# Calculate pivot points
pivot = (high + low + close) / 3
resistance1 = 2 * pivot - low
support1 = 2 * pivot - high
```

#### 5. Bollinger Bands Integration

**Implementation:** Add Bollinger Bands for volatility-based signals

```python
# Bollinger Bands signals
if price < lower_band:  # Oversold
    buy_signals += 1
if price > upper_band:  # Overbought
    sell_signals += 1
```

#### 6. Multi-timeframe Analysis

**Implementation:** Combine signals from different timeframes

```python
# 15min, 1hr, 4hr timeframes
short_term_signal = get_signal(15min_data)
medium_term_signal = get_signal(1hr_data)
long_term_signal = get_signal(4hr_data)
```

### Low Priority - Advanced Features

#### 7. Market Sentiment Analysis

**Implementation:** Add social media sentiment indicators

- Twitter sentiment analysis
- Reddit r/pepe sentiment
- Telegram channel sentiment

#### 8. Advanced Risk Management

**Implementation:** Dynamic position sizing based on volatility

```python
# Volatility-based position sizing
volatility_factor = 1 - (current_volatility / max_volatility)
position_size = base_position * volatility_factor
```

#### 9. Performance Analytics Dashboard

**Implementation:** Add detailed performance metrics

- Win rate analysis
- Average trade duration
- Sharpe ratio calculation
- Maximum drawdown tracking
